## US-01: Login Feature

### Step 1: Define the Fields & Rules
- Email Field
  - Must be a valid email format (e.g., name@domain.com).
  - Cannot be empty.
- Password Field
  - Cannot be empty.
  - Must be masked in the UI.
- Demo Account Shortcut
  
- Authentication Outcome
  - On success: authentication state stored in `AuthContext` (and persisted via storage/session as appropriate).
  - On failure: show a generic authentication error message.

### Step 2: Main User Story
- Story ID: US-01
- Title: User Login

As a registered user (student or faculty), I want to enter my email and password on a login screen so that I can access my role-specific dashboard and the application's features.

### Step 3: Acceptance Criteria (Detailed Rules)

Positive Path (Happy Path)
1. Validation – Given I am on the login page, when I provide a valid email and correct password and submit, then the system authenticates my credentials and redirects me to my role-specific dashboard (student or faculty).
2. Auth State – After successful login, the authentication state is set in `AuthContext` and persisted (e.g., localStorage/sessionStorage) so the user remains logged in across refreshes.

Negative Path (Errors & Edge Cases)
1. Empty Fields → Show required field errors for email and/or password.
2. Invalid Email → Show a format validation error for the email field.
3. Wrong Credentials → Show a generic authentication failure message (do not reveal whether email exists).
4. Email Not Found → Show the same generic authentication failure message.
5. Forgot Password → A link/button should navigate the user to a password reset flow (if implemented) or show instructions.

### Subtasks
• Design login form (UI).
• Create login API endpoint.
• Connect front-end to backend.
• Implement session handling.
• Test login with valid/invalid inputs.

### Project Approach Alignment
- I. Requirements: Validate login requirements with faculty and student stakeholders; secure authentication and role handling are core requirements.
- II. Design: Map UI mockups and Auth state flows; design secure session storage and DB schema for users (Supabase/MySQL).
- III. Development: Implement backend endpoints (Flask) and frontend wiring (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`, `src/pages/auth/Login.jsx`) during sprints.
- IV. Testing: Add unit and integration tests to verify authentication, session persistence, and role redirects.
- V. Deployment: Ensure auth endpoints are secured in production; enable incremental rollout for login features.
- VI. Review: Include login acceptance in sprint reviews and UAT with faculty/students.
