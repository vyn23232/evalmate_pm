## US-13: Layout & Navigation Components (Shared UI)

### Step 1: Fields & Rules
- Shared components: `Button`, `Card`, `Layout`, `Header`, `Sidebar`.
- Consistent global styles in `src/styles/globals.css`.

### Step 2: Main User Story
- Story ID: US-13
- Title: Shared Layout & Navigation

As any user, I want consistent navigation and layout so I can find features and move around the app quickly.

### Step 3: Acceptance Criteria
Positive Path
1. Header shows app-level navigation and notifications; sidebar shows role-appropriate links.
2. Shared components render consistently across pages.

Negative Path
1. On small screens, layout remains usable (responsive behavior).

### Subtasks
- Review and standardize components in `src/components/*`.
- Ensure `Layout.jsx` composes pages correctly.
- Add accessibility/keyboard navigation checks.
• Design login form (UI).
• Create login API endpoint.
• Connect front-end to backend.
• Implement session handling.
• Test login with valid/invalid inputs.

### Project Approach Alignment
- I. Requirements: Define which components are shared and accessibility requirements.
- II. Design: Produce component specs and a design system in Figma and `globals.css`.
- III. Development: Standardize `Button.jsx`, `Card.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, and `Sidebar.jsx` with tests.
- IV. Testing: Run a11y checks and cross-browser responsive tests.
- V. Deployment: Deliver as shared library within the app; monitor for styling regressions.
- VI. Review: Iterate on usability and accessibility feedback.
