## 📋 Conclusion

**Current Status**: The project has made excellent progress on the frontend implementation with a modern, professional interface that exceeds the original design expectations. However, **65% of the core functionality is still missing**, primarily due to the lack of backend and database implementation.

**Proposal Alignment**: While the project vision and user experience align well with the proposal, the technical implementation approach differs significantly (React vs. HTML/Bootstrap, no backend yet vs. Flask requirement).

**Path Forward**: The project needs immediate focus on backend development and database integration to meet the December 2025 deployment timeline and fulfill the core peer evaluation functionality promised in the proposal.

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH RISK** of missing deployment deadline without immediate backend development focus. The strong frontend foundation provides a good base for rapid backend integration once development begins.
